# Pradyuman's ATM DApp

Welcome to my Ethereum-based ATM DApp! This little project lets you deposit, withdraw, and transfer ETH using a smart contract. Plus, you can switch between light and dark mode for that sweet UI customization.

## What's Inside

- **MetaMask Integration**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to use the app.
- **Balance Check**: See how much ETH you have.
- **Deposit**: Add some ETH to your balance.
- **Withdraw**: Take some ETH out.
- **Transfer**: Send ETH to your friends.
- **Dark Mode**: Because who doesn't love dark mode?
- **Transaction History**: Logs all deposits and withdrawals, viewable through the front end.
- **Minimum/Maximum Limits**: Sets minimum and maximum limits for deposit and withdrawal amounts.
- **Pause Contract**: Allows pausing and resuming of deposits and withdrawals in case of emergencies.
